i am sitting in front of a sheet of paper. my right hand is bending over my left thumb. 
the first day i got out of my cast i could bend it by 15°. now i am already at 50° and that makes me happy. 
things are going uphil...

as you can imagine, it is rally bad news for a pianist when he get diagnosed with a broken thumb. 
that day i was sitting in the emergency room, feeling rather dizzy while thinking of a zillion shows 
coming up and all the people involved around it. i realised in that moment how busy things have become. 
it is hard to turn down interesting projects and opportunities, since i surely love my work. it actually 
never felt like work. playing piano and playing it for wonderful people is the greatest joy i can imagine.

for a couple of days i felt like this all could be over. how pathetic. butd hey – also feeeling sorry for
yourself has its place somewhere. all of a sudden i had so much time, an unexpected holiday. i cancelled 
most of my schedule and found myself beng a little bored. even though my doctor told me not to touch a piano for a while, 
i just couldn't resist. i started playing a silent song with 4 fingers on my left and the remaining 5 on my right hand. 
i set up one microphone and recorded anoter tune every other night before falling asleep.
